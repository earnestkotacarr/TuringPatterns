We build a visual simulator of turing patterns with interactive aspects
We will recreate the original simulation by Shiffman - https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/13-reaction-diffusion


2) We wil implement a different equation to create a new pattern
3) We will include colors and gradients
4) We will try to include some form of user interactivity
